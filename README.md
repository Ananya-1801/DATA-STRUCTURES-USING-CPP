# DATA STRUCTURES USING C++

Collection of programs on Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. 

### Table of Contents:
- **array as parameter.cpp** â€“ Generates an array of n natural numbers through a user defined function and returns the array.
- **array adt.cpp** - a menu driven program featuring the basic operations that can be performed over array abstract data type.
- **array_binarysearch.cpp** - implements binary search over an array abstract data-type.


### Purpose
This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures using C++, including arrays for now, and will later also contain, linked lists, stack, queues, trees and other structures.
It is a part of my learning journey and serves as a tool for revision. 

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the program
3. Run the executable
